Welcome, to my first one page application under name of Todoapp.

Todoapp is simple the most known javascript application by js programming tradition. It was built up on just three basics technologies used in every web development. There are html(for markup), css(for presentation) and js(behaviour) and one more technology to make runing tasks while preserving better organized code webpack.
